# Encrypted Python Chat with 2048-bit RSA Encryption

This project is a command-line-based chat application built in Python, secured with 2048-bit RSA encryption. The encryption effectiveness has been verified through packet sniffing, ensuring that all communications between hosts are securely encrypted.

## Features:
- **2048-bit RSA Encryption**: All messages are encrypted using a secure RSA algorithm, protecting your conversations.
- **Host or Connect**: Flexibly choose to host a chat session or connect to a host directly from the command line.
- **Packet Sniffing Validation**: The encryption integrity has been tested and proven secure through packet sniffing analysis.

## Usage:
- Host a chat server or connect to one using simple command-line commands.
- Enjoy secure, encrypted conversations over a local network or the internet.
